Hello everyone! I'd like to introduce my web application, which is built using Node.js, Firebase, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web application focuses on hostel complaint services, where users can submit their complaints, which are then routed to the admin. The admin reviews and resolves the complaints, after which they are displayed to both the users and the admin. Please feel free to review and improve the grammar and phrasing as needed
